# hello-world

=====================

A first step into a bigger world.

I'll be focusing on teaching myself Python so I can apply it to what I do at work.  I'd like a small script written by Feb 15.

Next steps are branching out into Greasemonkey and other browser (FF ESR and Chrome / Chromium) add-ons. GM script by June 30.

Line breaks happen with a blank line, or else text continues on the same string.
